# GraphQL


### Introduction

Graphql is a new and alternative API standard that was invented and open-sourced by Facebook to use besides REST.

### Main Points

* GraphQL enables declarative data fetching - client can specify which data they want exactly.
* GraphQL only expose a single endpoint for all resources, unlike REST with many endpoints.
