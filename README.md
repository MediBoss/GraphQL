# GraphQL


### Introduction

Graphql is a new and alternative API standard that was invented and open-sourced by Facebook to use besides REST.

### Main Points

* GraphQL enables declarative data fetching - client can specify which data they want exactly.
* GraphQL only expose a single endpoint for all resources, unlike REST with many endpoints.
* Less overfetching - downloading unessary data from the API
* Less underfetching - endpoints that does not return enough data, need to make another request. 
* GraphQL eliminates the need to adjust the API when product requirements and design have changed.
